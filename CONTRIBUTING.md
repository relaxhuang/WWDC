# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this and are willing to help. Watching all the sessions is pretty time-consuming and help is highly appreciated.

## Recommendations

I watch sessions in 1.5 speed using the awesome player from wwdc.io. This is the only way for me to watch so many sessions. You can try it and if it feels too fast, just reduce the speed to 1.25 which should be fine for most of the people.

## Submitting changes

First of all the list is not sorted. If you want to add a new session, please just put it at the bottom. Don't forget to add an entry to the `table of contents` and your name to `Contributors` 🤝

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/compare) with some notes of what you have done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Try to write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks so much for your contribution,
Stefan
